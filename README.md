# Tutorial: Enable your .NET application to sign-in users and call APIs with Azure AD CIAM

This tutorial aims to take you through the fundamentals of modern authentication with Azure AD Consumer Identity and Access Management (CIAM), using the [Microsoft Authentication Library for .NET](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js) and [Microsoft.Identity.Web](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web).

## Prerequisites

* Either [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started)

Please refer to each sample's README for sample-specific prerequisites.

## Recommendations

- [jwt.ms](https://jwt.ms) for inspecting your tokens
- [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) for monitoring your network activity and troubleshooting
- Follow the [Azure AD Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/bg-p/Identity) to stay up-to-date with the latest developments

Please refer to each sample's README for sample-specific recommendations.
