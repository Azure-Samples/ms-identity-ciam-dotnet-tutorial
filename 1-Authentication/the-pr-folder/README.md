## Overview

This sample demonstrates a ASP.NET Core Web App that authenticates users against Azure AD.

> :information_source: To learn how to integrate an application with Azure AD as a [multi-tenant](https://aka.ms/multi-tenant) app, consider going through the recorded session:[Develop multi-tenant applications with the Microsoft identity platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B416AxHoMJ4).

## Scenario

1. The client ASP.NET Core Web App uses the  to sign-in a user and obtain a JWT [ID Token](https://aka.ms/id-tokens) from **Azure AD CIAM**.
1. The **ID Token** proves that the user has successfully authenticated against **Azure AD CIAM**.

![Scenario Image](./ReadmeFiles/topology.png)

## Prerequisites

* Either [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started)
* An **Azure AD CIAM** tenant. For more information, see: [How to get an Azure AD CIAM tenant](https://github.com/microsoft/entra-previews/blob/PP2/docs/1-Create-a-CIAM-tenant.md)
* A user account in your **Azure AD CIAM** tenant.

## Setup the sample

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-ciam-dotnet-tutorial.git
```

or download and extract the repository *.zip* file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Step 2: Navigate to project folder

```console
cd 1-Authentication\4-sign-in-device-code-dotnet-core
```

### Step 3: Register the sample application(s) in your tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
   <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

> :warning: If you have never used **Microsoft Graph PowerShell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts Guide](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. For interactive process -in PowerShell, run:

    ```PowerShell
    cd .\AppCreationScripts\
    .\Configure.ps1 -TenantId "[Optional] - your tenant id" -AzureEnvironmentName "[Optional] - Azure environment, defaults to 'Global'"
    ```

> Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts guide](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md). The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

#### Choose the Azure AD CIAM tenant where you want to create your applications

To manually register the apps, as a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD CIAM tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD CIAM tenant.

#### Create User Flows

Please refer to: [Tutorial: Create user flow in Azure Active Directory CIAM](https://github.com/microsoft/entra-previews/blob/PP2/docs/3-Create-sign-up-and-sign-in-user-flow.md)

> :information_source: To enable password reset in Customer Identity Access Management (CIAM) in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), please refer to: [Tutorial: Enable self-service password reset](https://github.com/microsoft/entra-previews/blob/PP2/docs/4-Enable-password-reset.md)

#### Add External Identity Providers

Please refer to:

* [Tutorial: Add Google as an identity provider](https://github.com/microsoft/entra-previews/blob/PP2/docs/6-Add-Google-identity-provider.md)
* [Tutorial: Add Facebook as an identity provider](https://github.com/microsoft/entra-previews/blob/PP2/docs/7-Add-Facebook-identity-provider.md)

#### Register the dotnetDeviceCode app (DotnetDeviceCode)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD CIAM** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
    1. In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `DotnetDeviceCode`.
    1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox, Outlook.com)**
    1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the **Overview** blade, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Authentication** blade to the left.
    1. In the **Advanced settings** | **Default client type** section, flip the switch for `Treat application as a public client` to **Yes**.
    1. Click **Save** to save your changes.
1. Since this app signs-in users, we will now proceed to select **delegated permissions**, which is is required by apps signing-in users.
    1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs:
    1. Select the **Add a permission** button and then:
    1. Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
    1. In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, select **Microsoft Graph**
    1. In the **Delegated permissions** section, select **openid**, **offline_access** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
    1. Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.
1. At this stage, the permissions are assigned correctly, but since it's a CIAM tenant, the users themselves cannot consent to these permissions. To get around this problem, we'd let the [tenant administrator consent on behalf of all users in the tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-admin-consent). Select the **Grant admin consent for {tenant}** button, and then select **Yes** when you are asked if you want to grant consent for the requested permissions for all accounts in the tenant. You need to be a tenant admin to be able to carry out this operation.

##### Configure the dotnetDeviceCode app (DotnetDeviceCode) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `appsettings.json` file.
1. Find the key `ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `DotnetDeviceCode` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `TenantId` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant/directory ID.

### Step 4: Running the sample

From your shell or command line, execute the following commands:

```console
    cd 1-Authentication\4-sign-in-device-code-dotnet-core
    dotnet run
```

## Troubleshooting

<details>
	<summary>Expand for troubleshooting info</summary>

ASP.NET core applications create session cookies that represent the identity of the caller. Some Safari users using iOS 12 had issues which are described in ASP.NET Core #4467 and the Web kit bugs database Bug 188165 - iOS 12 Safari breaks ASP.NET Core 2.1 OIDC authentication.

If your web site needs to be accessed from users using iOS 12, you probably want to disable the SameSite protection, but also ensure that state changes are protected with CSRF anti-forgery mechanism. See the how to fix section of Microsoft Security Advisory: iOS12 breaks social, WSFed and OIDC logins #4647

## About the code

The code for handling the token acquisition process is simple, as it boils down to calling the `AcquireTokenWithDeviceCodeAsync` method of `PublicClientApplication` to which you pass a callback that will contain a `DeviceCodeResult` object which contains the URL a user will naviagte to and authenticate themselves. After that's done, an `AuthenticationResult` is returned containing an access token and some basic account information.

```CSharp
var result = await app.AcquireTokenWithDeviceCode(new [] { "openid" }, async deviceCode => {
    Console.WriteLine($"In a broswer, navigate to the URL '{deviceCode.VerificationUrl}' and enter the code '{deviceCode.UserCode}'");
    await Task.FromResult(0);
})
.ExecuteAsync();

Console.WriteLine($"You signed in as {result.Account.Username}");
Console.WriteLine($"{result.Account.HomeAccountId}");
Console.WriteLine("\nRetrieved access token:");
Console.WriteLine(result.AccessToken);
```
